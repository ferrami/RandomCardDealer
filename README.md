# Random Card Dealer CLI Python
<!--endhide-->

In this project you will learn how to use coding logic to generate random cards.

## Instructions

1. Create an algorithm that randomly builds a random card every time it runs.

2. Run the algorithm by typing: 
```
python3 app.py
```

3. Every time the algorithm runs a new random card needs to show on the console.

4. The card must have one of the possible suites: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamonds.

5. The card value must be one of the following: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace (no joker).

### Hints

- You can use emoji for the card suites: `♡ ♧ ♤ ♢`
